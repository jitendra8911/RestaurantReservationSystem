Hi. Welcome to Restaurant Reservation System

How to execute this project?

Copy the entire directory to your local directory. There are mainly two important html pages that are to be mentioned. One is for customers/guests which is home.html, and the other is for owner login, which is ownerHome.html.

Once you open home.html, a customer can browse through couple of quick links provided on home page which are create reservation and update reservation. If you are a owner, then you can login with your credentials and you will be redirected to ownerHome.html page (however since authentication is not implemented, there is currently no redirection, but you can still open ownerHome.html and see what are all the features available for owner).


What are functionalites provided to owner?

In the onwnerHome.html, a owner can create reservation, update reservation, view reservations, view contact list, view seating area, change profile and settings, change table, assign table among a few. If time permits, then I will also add few more functionalities to this project.
